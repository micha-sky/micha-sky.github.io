if you are a web developer sometimes you need to make screenshots of your web pages. you can use printcreen button, but you can't capture web page completely than way.

in this case you can use firefox: press shift + f2 and type in

{% highlight console %}
screenshot --fullpage filename.png
{% endhighlight %}
